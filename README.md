# <a id="top"></a> My Portfolio Website Project
## www.ajwhalley.com  or  http://awhalley-portfolio.netlify.com/

Below is the strategy and the creation of my portfolio website. The outcome for the project was to create my online presence for future employees and clients. I wanted my portfolio to be simple yet complete. To display my attitude and character. 

I selected a simple yet profession 3 colour scheme with 3 fronts and only the one photo of myself for the about section. I wanted it to be sleek and only have what a client or employer would need to see to hire me. 

The project was coded with only CSS and HTML. Through many challenges and finding solutions to those, I learnt a lot of new techniques and practices for future projects. Overall it was a challenging, fun and insightful project which I plan to expand on as a I develop more skills and build more projects.

# <a id="InspirationPhase"></a>Inspiration Phase

There are 2 major categories that I took care of before anything else. 

1. Progress tracking 

Before I got started I set up a Trello Board to use throughout my portfolio project. It helped to manage and break down the benchmarks and what has and still needs to be done. It gave me the certainty to know what I had done and how much I had left. Within it includes the brief that I received and the marking benchmarks so I knew what I was actually being marked on.            

The Trello Board can be found at this [link.](https://trello.com/b/25odDeYl/portfolio-website)

2. Inspiration 

The second was inspiration. I spent time going through Pinterest and collecting photos that I found inspiring. Whether they be because of color, layout or positioning of objects within. 

To have a look at my collection you can click [here.](https://www.pinterest.com.au/ajwhalley45/design-inspiration/)
     
From there I too some of the photos and included them withing my Figma Board to use for the design phase. That way I could see the colors and be inspired while deciding on colour palettes and layout.

# <a id="Wireframes"></a>Style Guide and Wireframes
For all the pre coding design, colour choice, typography, layout etc I used Figma. A program that I could map everything out first before coding. This was beyond helpful when it came to coding as I already knew where everything was going to be and had an idea of how it would work. More on that later. 

You can view my Figma designs [here.](https://www.figma.com/file/JEsIiT0Z3DiQoEyEMmz1BIhO/Portfolio-Design)

## Typography
My typography was inspired by finding a way to display my character mixed with style and most importantly user readability  and their experience. 

I selected 3 fonts. One for the main headings of each section that has a quirky stylish touch to it and then used code/programing like characters to add style. It's quite distinctive and only used for major titles as any more than that would be too much. The 2nd font was for the sub headings and is a Serif font that is stylish, easily read and paired really well with my main titles. The 3rd font is a San Serif font and used for all paragraphs and lengthy text. It's much easy for the user to ready. 

With the San Serif font I also increased the line hight to spread it out a little further as it made it even easier to read which is very important for the user.

## Colour Palette Choice 

For color I had a wide range to select from. I found and used the chrome extension Palette Creator which creates a 8,16,24,32 or custom colour palette from any photo you want. So from the inspiration photos I added to Figma from Pinterest I created a handful of different color schemes I liked. From there I tested a few out and landed on a 3 color scheme. I really dark blue, a gold like color and then a light grey. 

I then tested the colors contrast on one another via [Contrast Checker](https://contrastchecker.com/) to make sure they got the AAA rating. Again, it's crucial that the users can easily read the text and it's something they don't even think about or realise. It's a seamless experience. 

The colours go really well together and through the use of the right fonts I was able to create a profession, sleek and fun experience. 

The color psychology of each colour also reinforced the message I wanted to send: 

Gold is the color of success, achievement and triumph. Associated with abundance and prosperity,luxury and quality, prestige and sophistication, value and elegance, the color psychology of gold implies affluence, material wealth and extravagance.

White is color at its most complete and pure, the color of perfection. The color meaning of white is purity, innocence, wholeness and completion.

Blue is the color of trust and peace. It can suggest loyalty and integrity as well as conservatism and frigidity.

## Design & Layout 

From the very beginning I wanted the portfolio to have an open layout that is simple, profession and easy to navigate. I wanted it to have a good spread and be easily read and contain everything an employer would need. 

I search the web and found lists of different portfolio sights which I used as inspiration. From there I still didn't really know what I was going to do but I decided to sketch out what was in my mind and go from there. The rough sketches can be found in my Figma Portfolio Page linked about. 

From the drawings I then create the mock up layout and display in Figma and kept adding bits and pieces making iterations and changes constantly until I had a layout which I liked. From there, I made many more changes. 

I really wanted the site to be easily navigated because if an employer visits the sight and can't instantaneously know where to look than it's not effective.

# <a id="devprocess"></a>The Development Process
## What went well 

I think my Figma designing went really well. I found colors and a style that I liked and although it took me about 3 days to put it all together I enjoyed the final outcome and what I learnt along the way. 

When it comes to coding I learnt a lot and I think that is what went really well. I was able to learn how CSS grid and all the elements interact with each other when applying style. I now have a good grasp of how to position items on a website and confident in my ability to problem solves when something isn't right. 

## Challenges 
     
There were many challenges through building my portfolio site. I had to learn how the elements interact with padding, margin and within grids etc. 

The biggest challenge I had was aligning the menu within the header and making it open with the page area selections. 

The challenge was that some of the characters were eceeding their div because they were rotated 90 degrees. I learnt that when you rotate a character, it doesn't rotate the character on it's own. It rotates the block. When the characters were in a block it would rotate that block and through everything out of wack. I then had to change them to inline blocks which worked. 

The other bigger challenge was getting the menu to pop up without using JS and was usable for mobile. I didn't want to use the sudo element Hover because it wouldn't work on mobile so I used a checkbox input, changed the indext to be positioned infront of the menu and set the opacity to 0. From there I was able to trigger the animation the box is checked. 

In the future I will introduct JS so that the menu will automatically close when an option is slected.

# <a id="Coding"></a>Coding

I didn't start coding until I had completely finished my mock up designs in Figma. Looking back I found this really helpful. I think coding it from scratch without Figma would have been a nightmare. 

The Figma design gave me so much structure to reference off of. 

After the Figma design was done I started with the HTML, breaking my pages into header footer and 3 sections. From there I centered all of my content and moved onto the CSS. 

I had to come back to the HTML again and again but to start with I just got everything on the page within the major sections that I knew would exist. I then came back later and added a few divs and moved some content around etc.

I worked from the top down with a mobile first design. I fisnished everything besides the menus as they gave me the most trouble and then came back to them at the end. 

After finising the mobile version I expanded and to desktop and add a media query to alter the positioning of elements for a better desktop experience.

# <a id="Optimisation"></a>Optimisation

The 2 main things I optimized for the portfolio was the few photos and the user experience. The photos I edited via an online photo editor and saved them as a smaller file size that didn't diminish their quality. As a result I was able to shave off sever 100kbs of the files which enhances the speed of the site. 
The other main point is the users experience. There were many times where I wanted to add animations or extra navigation etc but decided against it because it wasn't what the user needed. The sight was built to display me but it designed for the user.

# <a id="tocome"></a>What's to come 

From here I still have a few things I would like to add and change around. But given time restraints I was not able to get them done prior to the deadline. 

1. Is that I will host this on my own domain www.ajwhalley.com 
2. I will add a favicon and probably a logo in my bottom footer 
3. Play with the positioning on desktop view 
4. Add a suddle glow to the home menu button to draw attention
5. Change the menu button to use JS instead of CSS 
6. Re-structure my HTML and CSS with grid to cut back styling 
7. Add robots.text file 
8. Change menu display for desktop view
